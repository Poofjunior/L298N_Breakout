#A quick-n-simple L298N breakout board.

## Usage
To etch this circuit board through the toner-transfer method, go to the board 
view and deselect all layers except for 'bottom', 'pads', and 'vias'.  Then 
print (unmirrored) the existing view at 100% scale onto HP photo paper.  

##A few notes:  
I haven't yet added the parts list.  
This breakout does not break out the current-sensing pins. The end-goal is to 
quickly etch (or mill) 4 of these to drive stepper motors.
